Kris Krindle App
============

A Tiny jQuery and PHP app that takes a list of people and an overall budget then matches everyone with a partner and sends out an email to everyone. Also known as Secret Santa. This was put online at public address on the detail.ie website for internal use. The next year we had to shut it down because other people found and used it, including a cohort from somewhere like the Central Bank or something. Very gas.
